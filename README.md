This program will prompt the user with a number of questions to determine eligibility of credit card bonuses.

Many of the 'big' credit card companies have implemented new rules/time-frames for receiving credit card bonuses. If you've already received the sign-up bonus for a particular card, the stipulations surrounding re-application are even more stringent. 


By answering the prompts, the user will have an output of cards bonuses they are eligible to recieve, of course the bank will need to approve the application first! Most of the cards listed have the most lucrative bonuses available, and not suprisingly, have the toughest rules surrounding approval.
