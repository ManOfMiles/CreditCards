This program will prompt the user with a number of questions to determine eligibility of credit card bonuses.

Many of the 'big' credit card companies have implemented new rules/time-frames for receiving credit card bonuses more than one time.


By answering the prompts, the user will have an output of cards bonuses they are eligible to recieve, of course the bank will need to approve the application first!
